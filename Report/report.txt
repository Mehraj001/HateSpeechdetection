ToastContainer and toast:
The ToastContainer and toast components from the react-toastify library are used to 
implement toast notifications in a React application. Toast notifications are small,
non-intrusive messages that appear briefly on the screen to provide feedback or 
information to the user. They are commonly used to display success messages, error
messages, or other non-critical information.
import { toast } from "react-toastify";
exmple,
// ...

const showSuccessToast = () => {
  toast.success("Success!");
};

const showErrorToast = () => {
  toast.error("Error!");
};
